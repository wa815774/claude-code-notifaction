# Release Checklist

Step-by-step guide for publishing a new version.

## 1. Bump version

Update the version string in **3 files** (4 occurrences total):

| File | Location | Count |
|------|----------|-------|
| `cmd/claude-code-notifaction/main.go` | `const version = "X.Y.Z"` | 1 |
| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | `"version": "X.Y.Z"` | 1 |
| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | `"version": "X.Y.Z"` | 2 |

Quick check — all occurrences should match:

```bash
grep -rn '1\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+' cmd/claude-code-notifaction/main.go .claude-plugin/plugin.json .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
```

## 2. Update CHANGELOG.md

Add a new section at the top following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format:

```markdown
## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- ...

### Changed
- ...

### Fixed
- ...
```

## 3. Run tests

```bash
make test-race
make lint
```

## 4. Commit, push, and wait for CI

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "release: vX.Y.Z"
git push origin main
```

**Wait for ALL CI checks to pass before tagging:**

```bash
gh run list --limit 5          # check status
gh run watch <run-id>          # wait for a specific run
```

All three workflows must be green: Ubuntu CI, macOS CI, Windows CI. If any fail — fix, push again, and wait. Do NOT create the tag until CI is green.

## 5. Tag and release

```bash
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin --tags
```

The `release.yml` workflow triggers on tag push and builds binaries for all platforms automatically.

## ClaudeNotifier.app (macOS)

ClaudeNotifier.app is **automatically built, signed, and notarized** by the `release.yml`
workflow as a `build-notifier` job. It runs in parallel with Go binary builds and the
resulting `ClaudeNotifier.app.zip` is included in the same GitHub Release.

The CI workflow:
1. Imports the Apple Developer certificate from GitHub Secrets
2. Builds a universal binary (arm64 + x86_64)
3. Signs with **Developer ID Application** + hardened runtime
4. Notarizes via `xcrun notarytool` and staples the ticket
5. Uploads `ClaudeNotifier.app.zip` as a release asset

### Required GitHub Secrets

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` | Base64-encoded .p12 export of Developer ID Application cert |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | Password for the .p12 file |
| `APPLE_ID` | Apple ID email for notarization |
| `APPLE_PASSWORD` | App-specific password for notarization |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Apple Developer Team ID |

### Local build (optional)

```bash
make build-notifier                                      # ad-hoc or local cert signing
cd swift-notifier && bash scripts/build-app.sh --ci      # Developer ID + notarization (needs env vars)
```

## 6. Update release description

The auto-generated release description is minimal. Edit it with a human-readable summary:

```bash
gh release edit vX.Y.Z --notes "$(cat <<'NOTES_EOF'

```

## 7. Notify relevant issues/PRs

Comment on fixed issues and merged PRs with a link to the release:

```bash
gh issue comment N --body "Fixed in [vX.Y.Z](https://github.com/wa815774/claude-code-notifaction/releases/tag/vX.Y.Z)."
gh pr comment N --body "Released in [vX.Y.Z](https://github.com/wa815774/claude-code-notifaction/releases/tag/vX.Y.Z)."
```

## How auto-update works

Users don't need to manually download binaries after a plugin update:

1. User updates the plugin via `/plugin` menu
2. This updates `plugin.json` with the new version
3. On the next hook invocation, `bin/hook-wrapper.sh` compares the installed binary version with `plugin.json`
4. If versions differ, it runs `install.sh --force` to download the matching binary from GitHub Releases
5. User sees a `[claude-notifications] Updated to vX.Y.Z` message
